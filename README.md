# TADT
Temperature-Adjusted Developmental Timer

Arduino code for a simple device designed to provide a staging metric for developing poikilothermic embryos that is compensated for fluctuations in temperature. The device monitors the temperature in real time and applies a linear thermal time model of the relationship between temperature and the rate of development.

STL files are also provided to 3D print a case for the device.

Further details will be provided shortly.
